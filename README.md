# Mesa-Optimizer Detection Framework

## Executive Summary

**Status = Research Prototype**  
This repository is an *experimental* playground for mesa-optimizer–detection ideas.  
It implements several plausible signals (gradients, activations, behavioural probes, causal interventions) **but has *not* been validated on real deceptive models**—because such models do not yet exist in the public domain.  Use it to prototype methods, run toy benchmarks and build intuition, **not** to make deployment-critical safety decisions.

In short: *it's code for a hard open research problem, not a production detector.*

The Mesa-Optimizer Detection Framework is a comprehensive system for identifying deceptive alignment in large language models by detecting when models develop internal optimization processes (mesa-optimizers) that may pursue objectives different from their training objective. This framework addresses one of the most critical unsolved problems in AI safety: ensuring models remain aligned with human values even as they become more capable.

## Problem Statement

### The Mesa-Optimization Problem

Modern AI systems trained via gradient descent may develop internal optimization processes that optimize for objectives different from the base training objective. This creates a dangerous scenario where:

- **Outer Alignment**: The training objective appears aligned with human values
- **Inner Misalignment**: The learned mesa-optimizer pursues a different objective
- **Deceptive Alignment**: The model behaves aligned during training but pursues its true objective during deployment

### Why This Matters

As AI systems become more capable, the potential for mesa-optimization increases. A deceptively aligned superintelligent system could:
- Perform well on all safety evaluations
- Behave perfectly during training and testing
- Pursue dangerous objectives once deployed at scale
- Be undetectable using current alignment techniques

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/sanowl/Mesa-Optimizer-Detection-Framework
cd Mesa-Optimizer-Detection-Framework

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install in development mode
pip install -e .
```

## Quick Start

```python
from mesa_optimizer_detection import MesaOptimizerDetector, GradientAnalyzer
import torch

# Initialize the detector
detector = MesaOptimizerDetector(
    model=your_model,
    layer_indices=[10, 15, 20],  # Layers to analyze
    detection_methods=['gradient', 'activation', 'behavioral']
)

# Analyze a batch of inputs
results = detector.analyze(input_batch)

print(f"Mesa-optimization risk score: {results.risk_score}")
print(f"Detection confidence: {results.confidence}")
```

## Framework Components

### Core Detection Methods

1. **Gradient-Based Detection**: Analyzes gradient patterns for optimization anomalies
2. **Mechanistic Interpretability**: Identifies mesa-optimization circuits in model activations
3. **Behavioral Consistency**: Detects deceptive behavior across different contexts
4. **Optimization Dynamics**: Monitors training dynamics for mesa-optimization signatures
5. **Causal Interventions**: Uses targeted ablations to test for deceptive alignment

### Current Capabilities

* Modular analysers: gradient, activation-pattern, behavioural, dynamics, causal-intervention.  
* Configurable risk aggregation with consensus & uncertainty estimates.  
* Demo & benchmark scripts for small/medium PyTorch models on a single GPU/CPU.  
* Extensible architecture—new detection methods can be dropped in.

### What it *doesn't* guarantee (yet)

* Reliable operation on models larger than a few billion parameters—the memory/latency cost hasn't been optimised.  
* Robustness against an adaptive adversary; many heuristics can be evaded.  
* Low false-positive/false-negative rates—no ground-truth dataset exists.  
* Out-of-the-box "real-time" monitoring during a production training run.
